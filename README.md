## Project Description:
This Truco Card Game project aims to recreate the traditional Spanish card game Truco in a digital format, allowing players from around the world to connect and compete in this strategy-based game. Truco is known for its complex rules, bluffing elements, and the requirement for strategic play, making it a challenging yet enjoyable game for card game enthusiasts. Our project encompasses a backend system developed using Spring Boot, ensuring a robust, scalable, and efficient gaming experience.

## Problem Statement:
Truco, while popular in certain regions, lacks global accessibility due to geographical and logistical constraints. The traditional game requires players to be physically present, limiting its reach. Our digital Truco project addresses this by offering an online platform where players can enjoy the game regardless of their location, breaking barriers and fostering a global community of Truco players.

## Functional Requirements:
- Online multiplayer functionality allowing users to create, join, and play games with friends or random players.
- Real-time game state management to ensure a seamless gaming experience across different networks.
- A chat system enabling players to communicate during games, enhancing the social aspect of Truco.
- Comprehensive rule implementation to mirror the traditional game, including scoring, bluffing, and calling.
- User account management for tracking statistics, achievements, and game history.
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

## Prototype:
Our prototype showcases the core functionalities of the Truco game, including lobby creation, game sessions, real-time updates, and a basic UI for game interaction. It demonstrates the feasibility of a fully digital Truco game that maintains the essence of the traditional card game while introducing the convenience and reach of online play.

## Demonstration Narrative:
Imagine connecting with friends or players worldwide for a quick game of Truco, seamlessly orchestrated through our digital platform. The game proceeds with players strategizing, bluffing, and making calls, all in real-time, with each action reflected immediately on every participant's screen. Victory brings not just in-game points but also the option to review game strategies and interact with fellow players, making each session more than just a gameâ€”it becomes an engaging social experience.
